Vaidotas Stankevicius, Kotryna Kvederaviciute, Liepa Gasiulė, Audronė Ruksenaite, Giedrius Vilkaitis and Saulius Klimasauskas

Sample codes to reproduce the analysis results.

## Requirements
R (at least v4.3)
Bioconductor (v3.19)

## Getting Started
These codes demonstrate how to reproduce most findings from Stankevicius et al. paper. There are multiple R files in the code directory that correspond to individual analysis and figures.

## Input data 
Raw and processed data may be downloaded from GEO (GSE281224).
